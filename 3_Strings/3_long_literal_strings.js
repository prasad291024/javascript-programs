//If the string length is too big it does not fit in one line.
//  We can use the backslash character (\) at the end of each line to indicate that the string will continue on the next line.

const paragraph = "My name is John Doe. I live in Canada, Toronto.\
I am a software developer and I love coding. I teach JavaScript, Python, SQL, Node.js, React, Redux, \
Vue.js, Data Structures and Algorithms for anyone who is eager to learn. \
In the end of 2020, I was thinking of expanding my reach and started a coding challenge from January 10 - February 10.\
It was one of the most rewarding and motivational experiences.\
Now, we are in 2021. I am enjoying preparing the FullStackDeveloper challenge and \
I hope you are enjoying too."
