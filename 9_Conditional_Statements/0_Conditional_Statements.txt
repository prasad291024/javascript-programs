JavaScript Conditional Statements
----------------------------------

Conditional statements are used to make decisions based on different conditions. By default, statements in a JavaScript program are executed sequentially from top to bottom. However, if the logic of the program requires it, this flow can be altered in two main ways:

1. Conditional Execution:
   A block of one or more statements is executed only if a specific condition evaluates to true.

2. Repetitive Execution:
   A block of one or more statements is executed repeatedly as long as a specific condition remains true.
   (Note: This is typically handled using loops and is covered separately.)

In this section, we focus on conditional execution using the following constructs:

Types of Conditional Statements in JavaScript:
--------------------------------------------------

1. if Statement:
   Executes a block of code if the specified condition is true.

   Example:
   if (score > 50) {
     console.log("You passed!");
   }

2. if...else Statement:
   Executes one block if the condition is true, and another block if it is false.

   Example:
   if (score > 50) {
     console.log("You passed!");
   } else {
     console.log("You failed.");
   }

3. if...else if...else Statement:
   Checks multiple conditions in sequence and executes the first block that matches.

   Example:
   if (score > 90) {
     console.log("Excellent!");
   } else if (score > 75) {
     console.log("Good job!");
   } else {
     console.log("Keep trying.");
   }

4. switch Statement:
   Evaluates an expression and matches it against multiple case values.

   Example:
   switch (grade) {
     case 'A':
       console.log("Excellent!");
       break;
     case 'B':
       console.log("Good!");
       break;
     default:
       console.log("Needs improvement.");
   }

5. Ternary Operator:
   A shorthand way to write simple if...else statements.

   Example:
   const result = (score > 50) ? "Pass" : "Fail";

--------------------------------------------------
Note:
Comparison operators (==, ===, !=, >, <, >=, <=) and logical operators (&&, ||, !) are commonly used in conditional expressions.
--------------------------------------------------

Conditional statements are essential for controlling the flow of logic in any JavaScript program. They allow your code to make decisions and respond dynamically to different inputs and situations.
